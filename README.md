# JavaPrograms repo #

## This repository was made to remind myself of the fundamentals of the Java programming language. From printing a simple "Hello World!" message to more advanced, complex tasks. ##

### BankTransactions.java ###

This simple Java program demonstrates the **manipulation of variables** using a banking example.  
The main goal is to show how values can be updated when performing operations such as **withdrawals** and **deposits** on a bank account.

### PersonalData.java ###

The PersonalData.java program represents a **simple personal profile** using different variables.  
It demonstrates how multiple pieces of information (with different data types) can be stored, manipulated, and displayed meaningfully.

The program stores 5 different attributes of a person, each with its appropriate data type:
+ Person's name
+ Person's age
+ Gender ('M' for male, 'F' for female)
+ Annual salary
+ Marital status

### Reservation.java ###

That class simulates a **restaurant reservation management system**.  
It demonstrates the use of **conditional operators** (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in real-world logic for checking reservations.


### TemperatureConverter.java ####

Last but not least, this Java program demonstrates a **basic temperature conversion** from **Celsius (Centigrade)** to **Fahrenheit** using a simple formula.  
It highlights **variable declaration**, **arithmetic operations**, and **formatted output**.
